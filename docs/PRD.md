# SignalCX: Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Draft
**Author:** AI Prototyper
**Last Updated:** [[Current Date]]

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Objective

SignalCX is a web-based dashboard that connects to support ticket data (e.g., Zendesk) and leverages generative AI to provide deep, actionable insights that go far beyond standard reporting. The primary objective of this product is to transform customer support operations from a reactive "firefighting" model to a proactive, predictive, and data-driven function.

### 1.2. Problem Statement

Support teams, particularly managers, face significant challenges in understanding the true drivers of their ticket volume and customer satisfaction. Traditional dashboards show *what* is happening (e.g., ticket volume, CSAT scores) but fail to explain *why* it's happening or *what* is likely to happen next. This leads to several problems:

*   **Reactive Management:** Managers spend their time reacting to crises rather than preventing them.
*   **Inefficient Coaching:** Coaching is often based on anecdotal evidence rather than data, making it less effective.
*   **Hidden Issues:** Emerging product flaws or widespread customer confusion can go unnoticed for weeks, buried in thousands of tickets.
*   **Inaccurate Staffing:** Without reliable forecasting, it's difficult to staff the support team appropriately, leading to burnout or wasted resources.
*   **Poor Customer Experience:** At-risk customers are often identified only *after* they leave negative feedback or breach their SLA.

### 1.3. Target Audience & User Personas

The application is designed for two primary user roles within a customer support organization:

*   **Persona 1: The Support Manager (e.g., Sarah)**
    *   **Goals:** Improve team efficiency, increase customer satisfaction (CSAT), reduce SLA breaches, and provide effective agent coaching.
    *   **Needs:** A high-level overview of team performance, predictive insights to anticipate problems, data-driven tools to identify coaching opportunities, and the ability to quickly spot emerging trends.

*   **Persona 2: The Support Agent (e.g., John)**
    *   **Goals:** Resolve tickets efficiently and accurately, meet performance targets, and understand their own performance.
    *   **Needs:** A clear, prioritized view of their tickets, tools to quickly understand complex ticket histories (like AI summaries), and insights into emerging issues to better serve customers.

| AI-06 | **AI-Powered Search**               | Users shall be able to ask natural language questions about the tickets in the current view (e.g., "Show me all tickets from user X about billing"). The AI must provide a natural language answer and a list of matching tickets.                | High     |
| AI-07 | **Social Intelligence Analysis**    | Users shall be able to query a topic (e.g., "sentiment about our new feature"). The AI will search the live web, analyze public sentiment from sources like Reddit and blogs, and return a structured summary of findings.                          | High     |
| AI-08 | **AI-Driven Coaching Insights**     | For managers, the AI shall analyze a sample of agent tickets and generate specific, actionable points of praise and opportunities for improvement for each team member, complete with example ticket IDs.                                         | High     |
| AI-09 | **Automated Trend Summary**         | On the main dashboard, the AI shall analyze the aggregated data for the selected time period and generate a concise, one-paragraph summary of the key trends.                                                                                     | High     |
| AI-10 | **Documentation Opportunities**     | As part of its analysis, the AI shall identify recurring problems that could be solved with new help articles or macros, providing justification and example tickets for each opportunity.                                                          | Should-have |

## 3. Success Metrics

The success of SignalCX will be measured by its ability to drive tangible improvements in support operations.

*   **Efficiency Metrics:**
    *   Reduction in Average First Response Time.
    *   Reduction in Average Resolution Time.
    *   Increase in First Contact Resolution (FCR) rate.
*   **Quality & Satisfaction Metrics:**
    *   Increase in average Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) score.
    *   Reduction in the number of tickets with negative sentiment.
    *   Reduction in SLA breach rate.
*   **Engagement Metrics:**
    *   Weekly active usage of the Manager Coaching and Predictive Analysis views.
    *   Number of custom dashboards saved by users.

## 4. Assumptions & Constraints

*   **Assumption:** The quality of AI insights is directly proportional to the quality and volume of the underlying ticket data.
*   **Assumption:** Support managers and agents are willing to adopt a new tool and trust AI-driven recommendations.
*   **Constraint:** The initial version will be a functional prototype using mock data and will be architected for, but not fully integrated with, a live Zendesk instance.
*   **Constraint:** The application relies on external AI APIs (Google AI), and is therefore subject to their availability, rate limits, and costs.
*   **Constraint:** PII (Personally Identifiable Information) must be programmatically scrubbed or pseudonymized before being sent to the AI models.

## 5. Out of Scope (for V1)

The following features are explicitly out of scope for the initial version of this prototype to ensure focus on the core value proposition:

*   **Direct Ticket Actions:** The application is for analysis, not action. Users will not be able to reply to tickets, change status, or add tags directly from the SignalCX interface.
*   **Real-time Data Streaming:** Data will be fetched on-demand or on a periodic basis, not streamed in real-time.
*   **Custom AI Model Training:** The prototype will use pre-trained, general-purpose models from the Google AI API, not custom-trained models.
*   **User-definable Rules:** Users will not be able to create their own custom rules for alerting or analysis (e.g., "alert me when X happens").
*   **Advanced User Management:** The application will have a simple role system (Manager/Agent) but will not include features for inviting new users, managing permissions, or team hierarchies.
