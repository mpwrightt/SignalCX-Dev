# SignalCX: AI-Powered Support Analytics

**SignalCX** is a functional, high-fidelity prototype of a web-based dashboard that connects to support ticket data (like Zendesk) and uses generative AI to provide deep, actionable insights that go far beyond standard reporting. It's designed to help support teams understand not just *what* is happening in their support queues, but *why* it's happening, and *what* is likely to happen next.

This project was built in **Firebase Studio**.
